## Difference btw NoSQL and Relational Database
[GeekforGeek](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-relational-database-and-nosql/)

### Relational Database

**Data is store in the form of row that is in the form of tuple.** 
Relational Database contains numbers of TABLE and DATA 

### NoSQL  
NoSQL Database stands for a non-SQL database. 
NoSQL database doesnâ€™t use table to store the data like relational database.  
It is used for storing and fetching the data in database and generally used to store the large amount of data.

### Transaction 

- [Data Base Transaction](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/974596/what-is-a-database-transaction)    
**A transaction is A UNIT of work that you want to treat as A WHOLE.**    
It has to either happen in FULL or NOT AT ALL.     

**Transactions are there to ensure, that no matter what happens, the data you work with will be in SENSIBLE STATE**. For example 
```vim
# operation 1
accountA -= 100;
accountB += 100;

# operation 2
accountB += 100;
accountA -= 100;
```
- If something goes wrong between the first and the second operation in the pair you have a problem - either 100 bucks have disappeared, or they have appeared out of nowhere.

**A transaction is a mechanism that allows you to mark A GROUP OF OPERATIONS and execute them in such a way that either they all execute (`commit`), or the system state will be as if they have not started to execute at all (ROLLBACK).**
```vim
---------- beginTransaction ------------------------   +
accountB += 100;                                       +  A GROUP OF OPERATONS
accountA -= 100;                                       +  A UNIT OF WORK
---------- commitTransaction -----------------------   +
```
- It guarantees that there will NOT be a situation where money is withdrawn from one account, but not deposited to another.
